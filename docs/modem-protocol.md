## 1  Overview

The gateway runs on a host computer that has no ESP-NOW radio hardware. An ESP32-S3 connected via USB acts as a **radio modem** — a transparent bridge between the host and the ESP-NOW wireless network:

```
┌──────────┐   USB-CDC   ┌──────────────┐  ESP-NOW  ┌──────────────┐
│  Gateway │◄───────────►│  ESP32-S3    │◄ ─ ─ ─ ─ ►│  Sensor Node │
│  (host)  │   serial    │  Radio Modem │   radio   │  (ESP32-C3)  │
└──────────┘             └──────────────┘           └──────────────┘
```

The modem is **protocol-unaware**: it does not perform HMAC verification, CBOR parsing, session management, or any cryptographic operation. It relays opaque byte frames between USB and radio, adding only the peer MAC address and RSSI metadata.

### 1.1  Design principles

- **Simplicity** — length-prefixed framing on a reliable byte stream. No byte stuffing, no escaping.
- **Transparency** — the modem does not interpret frame contents; the gateway controls all protocol logic.
- **Testability** — the protocol works identically over USB-CDC, a Linux PTY pair, or a TCP socket, enabling hardware-free end-to-end testing.
- **Fire-and-forget sends** — the gateway does not wait for per-frame delivery acknowledgement. The modem tracks failure counters that the gateway polls periodically.

## 2  Serial framing

USB-CDC provides reliable, ordered byte delivery. The protocol uses simple length-prefixed framing with no byte stuffing.

### 2.1  Frame envelope

```
┌───────────┬──────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│  LEN (2B) │ TYPE (1B)│  BODY (0 .. N bytes)         │
│  BE u16   │          │                              │
└───────────┴──────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `len` | Unsigned integer | 2 bytes, big-endian | Length of TYPE + BODY in bytes (does not include the LEN field itself). Minimum value: 1. Maximum value: 512. |
| `type` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | Message type discriminator (see §3). |
| `body` | Bytes | 0 .. 511 bytes | Type-specific payload. |

The maximum body size of 511 bytes provides generous headroom above the 250-byte ESP-NOW frame limit plus the 6-byte MAC address overhead.

### 2.2  Receiver behavior

- Frames with `len` = 0 MUST be silently discarded.
- Frames with `len` > 512 MUST be treated as a framing error. The receiver MUST NOT skip `len` bytes (the value is untrusted and could be up to 65,535). Instead, the receiver MUST initiate the `RESET`-based resynchronization procedure (§2.3).
- Frames with an unknown `type` value MUST be silently discarded (forward compatibility).

### 2.3  Synchronization recovery

If the gateway opens a serial port mid-stream (e.g., after a modem reset or hot-plug), it may land in the middle of a frame. Recovery procedure:

1. Gateway sends `RESET` (TYPE = 0x01, empty body).
2. Modem firmware resets its receive-side framing parser on any `RESET` command and then sends a `MODEM_READY` frame (`LEN` = 0x00 0x0B, `TYPE` = 0x81, 10-byte body).
3. After sending `RESET`, the gateway MUST discard received bytes until it observes a valid `MODEM_READY` frame: a two-byte big-endian length of 11 (`0x00 0x0B`), followed by `TYPE` = `0x81`, followed by exactly 10 bytes of body (`firmware_version` + `mac_address`). This deterministic framing pattern allows the gateway to resynchronize even if the `RESET` was sent mid-frame.

---

## 3  Message types

Message types are partitioned by direction:

| Range | Direction |
|-------|-----------|
| 0x01 – 0x7F | Gateway → Modem (commands) |
| 0x81 – 0xFF | Modem → Gateway (events / responses) |

### 3.1  Gateway → Modem

| Type | Name | Body | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| 0x01 | `RESET` | (empty) | Reset modem state, re-initialize ESP-NOW, clear peer table. Modem responds with `MODEM_READY`. |
| 0x02 | `SEND_FRAME` | §4.1 | Transmit an ESP-NOW frame to a specified peer. Fire-and-forget. |
| 0x03 | `SET_CHANNEL` | §4.2 | Set the WiFi/ESP-NOW channel. Modem responds with `SET_CHANNEL_ACK`. |
| 0x04 | `GET_STATUS` | (empty) | Query modem status and counters. Modem responds with `STATUS`. |
| 0x05 | `SCAN_CHANNELS` | (empty) | Perform a WiFi AP scan across all channels. Modem responds with `SCAN_RESULT`. |
| 0x20 | `BLE_INDICATE` | §4.9 | Send a BLE indication to the connected phone (gateway response wrapped in BLE envelope). |

### 3.2  Modem → Gateway

| Type | Name | Body | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| 0x81 | `MODEM_READY` | §4.3 | Modem is initialized and ready. Sent on boot and after `RESET`. |
| 0x82 | `RECV_FRAME` | §4.4 | An inbound ESP-NOW frame was received from a node. |
| 0x84 | `SET_CHANNEL_ACK` | §4.5 | Confirms a channel change. |
| 0x85 | `STATUS` | §4.6 | Modem status and counters (response to `GET_STATUS`). |
| 0x86 | `SCAN_RESULT` | §4.7 | Per-channel AP survey results (response to `SCAN_CHANNELS`). |
| 0x8F | `ERROR` | §4.8 | Unrecoverable modem error. |
| 0xA0 | `BLE_RECV` | §4.10 | A BLE GATT write was received from the connected phone. |

---

## 4  Message definitions

All multi-byte integers are big-endian unless otherwise stated.

### 4.1  SEND_FRAME (Gateway → Modem)

Transmit `frame_data` to the specified peer via ESP-NOW. The modem auto-registers unknown peer MACs transparently. This is a fire-and-forget operation — no per-frame response is sent. Delivery failures are counted in `tx_fail_count` (see §4.6).

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐
│  peer_mac (6B)   │  frame_data (N bytes)            │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `peer_mac` | Bytes | 6 bytes | Destination MAC address. `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` for broadcast. |
| `frame_data` | Bytes | 1 .. 250 bytes | Opaque frame to transmit. The modem does not inspect or modify this data. |

### 4.2  SET_CHANNEL (Gateway → Modem)

Set the WiFi channel used for ESP-NOW communication.

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `channel` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | WiFi channel number (1 – 14). |

The modem MUST respond with `SET_CHANNEL_ACK` (§4.5) after the channel change takes effect. The modem clears its ESP-NOW peer table on channel change.

### 4.3  MODEM_READY (Modem → Gateway)

Sent when the modem has completed initialization and is ready to send and receive ESP-NOW frames. The gateway MUST wait for this message before sending any other commands.

```
┌────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│  firmware_version (4B) │  mac_address (6B)│
└────────────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `firmware_version` | Unsigned integer | 4 bytes, big-endian | Modem firmware version (semantic: major.minor.patch.build, one byte each). |
| `mac_address` | Bytes | 6 bytes | The modem's own WiFi MAC address (the source address for all transmitted ESP-NOW frames). |

This message is sent:
- On power-up / USB enumeration (within 2 seconds).
- After a `RESET` command.
- After USB-CDC reconnection (if the host disconnected and reconnected).

### 4.4  RECV_FRAME (Modem → Gateway)

An ESP-NOW frame was received from a remote peer.

```
┌──────────────────┬────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐
│  peer_mac (6B)   │  rssi (1B) │  frame_data (N bytes)            │
└──────────────────┴────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `peer_mac` | Bytes | 6 bytes | Source MAC address of the remote peer. |
| `rssi` | Signed integer | 1 byte (i8) | Received signal strength in dBm (typically −30 to −90). |
| `frame_data` | Bytes | 1 .. 250 bytes | The received frame, unmodified. |

The modem forwards **all** received ESP-NOW frames without filtering. The gateway is responsible for authentication and discarding unrecognized frames.

### 4.5  SET_CHANNEL_ACK (Modem → Gateway)

Confirms that the ESP-NOW channel has been changed.

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `channel` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | The new active channel. |

### 4.6  STATUS (Modem → Gateway)

Response to `GET_STATUS`. Reports modem health and counters.

```
┌────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────────┐
│ channel(1B)│ uptime_s (4B) │ tx_count(4B) │ rx_count(4B) │ tx_fail_count(4B) │
└────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `channel` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | Current WiFi channel. |
| `uptime_s` | Unsigned integer | 4 bytes, big-endian | Seconds since last boot or `RESET`. |
| `tx_count` | Unsigned integer | 4 bytes, big-endian | Total ESP-NOW frames transmitted (including failures). |
| `rx_count` | Unsigned integer | 4 bytes, big-endian | Total ESP-NOW frames received and forwarded to USB. |
| `tx_fail_count` | Unsigned integer | 4 bytes, big-endian | ESP-NOW send failures (MAC-layer delivery failed). |

Counters reset to zero on boot and on `RESET`. The gateway polls `GET_STATUS` periodically (e.g., every 30 seconds) to monitor modem health and detect send failures.

### 4.7  SCAN_RESULT (Modem → Gateway)

Response to `SCAN_CHANNELS`. Reports per-channel WiFi AP activity to help the administrator select the least congested channel.

```
┌────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ count (1B) │ entries: (channel[1] | ap_count[1] | strongest_rssi[1]) × N  │
└────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `count` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | Number of channel entries (typically 14 for channels 1–14). |
| `channel` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | WiFi channel number. |
| `ap_count` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | Number of APs detected on this channel (capped at 255). |
| `strongest_rssi` | Signed integer | 1 byte (i8) | RSSI of the strongest AP on this channel (dBm). 0 if no APs detected. |

Each entry is 3 bytes. For all 14 channels the total body is 1 + (14 × 3) = 43 bytes.

**Important:** Channel scanning temporarily takes over the WiFi radio (~2–3 seconds). Inbound ESP-NOW frames may be dropped during a scan. This command should only be used during initial setup or administrator-triggered maintenance, not during normal gateway operation.

### 4.8  ERROR (Modem → Gateway)

Reports an unrecoverable modem error. The gateway should log this and may attempt a `RESET`.

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `error_code` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | Error category (see table below). |
| `message` | UTF-8 string | 0 .. N bytes | Human-readable error description. |

| Error code | Name | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 0x01 | `ESPNOW_INIT_FAILED` | ESP-NOW initialization failed. |
| 0x02 | `WIFI_INIT_FAILED` | WiFi stack initialization failed. |
| 0x03 | `CHANNEL_SET_FAILED` | Failed to set the requested channel. |
| 0xFF | `UNKNOWN` | Unclassified error. |

### 4.9  BLE_INDICATE (Gateway → Modem)

Gateway sends a BLE indication payload to the connected phone via the Gateway Command characteristic. The modem handles indication fragmentation per ATT MTU (see ble-pairing-protocol.md §3.4). This is a fire-and-forget operation — no per-message response is sent. If no BLE client is connected, the modem silently discards the message.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  ble_data (N bytes)              │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `ble_data` | Bytes | 1 .. 511 bytes | Opaque payload relayed to the BLE client. Typically a BLE message envelope (TYPE + LEN + BODY per ble-pairing-protocol.md §4), but the modem does not inspect or validate the contents. A `BLE_INDICATE` with an empty body (len = 1, i.e. type byte only, no `ble_data`) is invalid and MUST be silently discarded by the modem. |

### 4.10  BLE_RECV (Modem → Gateway)

A BLE GATT write was received on the Gateway Command characteristic from the connected phone. The modem forwards the complete reassembled write payload (after Write Long reassembly if applicable). Empty GATT writes (zero payload bytes) MUST be silently discarded — no `BLE_RECV` is sent.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  ble_data (N bytes)              │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `ble_data` | Bytes | 1 .. 511 bytes | Opaque payload received from the BLE client. Typically a BLE message envelope (TYPE + LEN + BODY per ble-pairing-protocol.md §4), but the modem does not inspect or validate the contents. |

### 4.11  BLE_CONNECTED (Modem → Gateway)

A BLE client connected to the Gateway Pairing Service and completed LESC pairing. Sent after MTU negotiation and LESC pairing succeed.

```
┌──────────────────┬────────────┐
│  peer_addr (6B)  │  mtu (2B)  │
└──────────────────┴────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `peer_addr` | Bytes | 6 bytes | BLE address of the connected phone. |
| `mtu` | Unsigned integer | 2 bytes, big-endian | Negotiated ATT MTU. Always ≥ 247. |

### 4.12  BLE_DISCONNECTED (Modem → Gateway)

The BLE client disconnected from the Gateway Pairing Service.

```
┌──────────────────┬──────────────┐
│  peer_addr (6B)  │  reason (1B) │
└──────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| `peer_addr` | Bytes | 6 bytes | BLE address of the disconnected phone. |
| `reason` | Unsigned integer | 1 byte | BLE HCI disconnect reason code. |

## 5  Message flows

### 5.1  Startup

The gateway MUST always send `RESET` when opening the serial port, regardless of whether the modem was just powered on or was already running. This ensures deterministic state.

```
Gateway                          Modem
   │                               │
   │──── [open serial port] ──────►│
   │──── RESET ───────────────────►│
   │                               │
   │◄──── MODEM_READY ─────────────│
   │                               │
   │──── SET_CHANNEL(ch) ─────────►│
   │◄──── SET_CHANNEL_ACK(ch) ─────│
   │                               │
   │  ════ normal operation ════   │
```

Any `MODEM_READY` received before `RESET` completes (e.g., from USB enumeration) is discarded. The gateway only accepts `MODEM_READY` after it has sent `RESET`.

### 5.2  Normal operation (frame relay)

During normal operation, two independent flows run concurrently:

**Inbound (radio → gateway):** The modem sends `RECV_FRAME` whenever an ESP-NOW frame arrives. These are asynchronous — they can arrive at any time, interleaved with responses to gateway commands.

```
Gateway                          Modem
   │                               │
   │◄──── RECV_FRAME ──────────────│  (node sent a WAKE)
   │                               │
   │──── SEND_FRAME ──────────────►│  (gateway sends COMMAND)
   │                               │
   │◄──── RECV_FRAME ──────────────│  (node sent GET_CHUNK)
   │──── SEND_FRAME ──────────────►│  (gateway sends CHUNK)
   │          ⋮                    │
```

**Outbound (gateway → radio):** The gateway sends `SEND_FRAME` which the modem transmits immediately. No per-frame response is expected.

### 5.3  Health check

```
Gateway                          Modem
   │                               │
   │──── GET_STATUS ──────────────►│
   │◄──── STATUS ──────────────────│
   │                               │
```

The gateway polls periodically (recommended: every 30 seconds). A rising `tx_fail_count` indicates radio delivery problems.

### 5.4  Channel survey

```
Gateway                          Modem
   │                               │
   │──── SCAN_CHANNELS ───────────►│
   │        (radio scanning        │
   │         ~2–3 seconds)         │
   │◄──── SCAN_RESULT ─────────────│
   │                               │
```

ESP-NOW reception is interrupted during the scan. This flow is only used during setup or maintenance.

### 5.5  Error recovery

```
Gateway                          Modem
   │                               │
   │◄──── ERROR(code, msg) ────────│
   │                               │
   │──── RESET ───────────────────►│
   │◄──── MODEM_READY ─────────────│
   │──── SET_CHANNEL(ch) ─────────►│
   │◄──── SET_CHANNEL_ACK(ch) ─────│
   │                               │
```

On `ERROR`, the gateway logs the error and sends `RESET` to attempt recovery.

### 5.6  BLE pairing relay

When a phone connects via BLE for pairing, the modem relays GATT messages between the phone and the gateway:

```
Gateway                          Modem                            Phone
   │                               │                               │
   │                               │◄──── BLE connect ─────────────│
   │◄──── BLE_CONNECTED ──────────│                               │
   │                               │                               │

   │                               │                               │
   │──── BLE_INDICATE ────────────►│                               │

   │                               │                               │
   │                               │◄──── GATT write ──────────────│

   │                               │                               │
   │──── BLE_INDICATE ────────────►│                               │

   │                               │                               │
   │                               │◄──── BLE disconnect ──────────│
   │◄──── BLE_DISCONNECTED ────────│                               │
```

BLE pairing relay operates concurrently with ESP-NOW frame relay (§5.2). The modem MUST NOT block ESP-NOW operations while a BLE client is connected.

---

## 6  Error handling

### 6.1  Invalid frames

| Condition | Receiver behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `len` = 0 | Silently discard. |
| `len` > 512 | Framing error. MUST NOT skip `len` bytes (untrusted value). Trigger `RESET`-based resynchronization (§2.3). |
| Unknown `type` | Silently discard (forward compatibility). |
| `SEND_FRAME` body < 7 bytes (no MAC + data) | Modem silently discards. |
| `SET_CHANNEL` with `channel` = 0 or > 14 | Modem sends `ERROR` with code `CHANNEL_SET_FAILED`. |

### 6.2  Missing responses

The gateway expects responses for request-response commands. If a response is not received within the timeout (§7), the gateway should:

1. Log the timeout.
2. Send `RESET` and re-run the startup sequence (§5.1).

`SEND_FRAME` is fire-and-forget and has no expected response — it cannot time out.

### 6.3  USB disconnection

If the USB-CDC link drops:

- **Modem side:** Continues running, discards inbound ESP-NOW frames, re-sends `MODEM_READY` on reconnection.
- **Gateway side:** Detects the serial port closure, logs the event, and re-opens the port when available. On reconnection, sends `RESET` and re-runs startup (§5.1).

### 6.4  Unsolicited messages

The modem may send `RECV_FRAME` or `ERROR` at any time, interleaved with responses to gateway commands. The gateway's serial reader must demultiplex:

- `RECV_FRAME` → deliver to the `Transport::recv()` caller.
- `ERROR` → log and optionally trigger recovery.
- Expected response (e.g., `STATUS`, `SET_CHANNEL_ACK`) → deliver to the waiting command.

---

## 7  Timing

| Event | Timeout | Action on timeout |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `MODEM_READY` after `RESET` or port open | 5 seconds | Log error, retry `RESET` (up to 3 attempts), then fail. |
| `SET_CHANNEL_ACK` after `SET_CHANNEL` | 2 seconds | Log error, send `RESET`, re-run startup. |
| `STATUS` after `GET_STATUS` | 2 seconds | Log warning, skip this poll cycle. |
| `SCAN_RESULT` after `SCAN_CHANNELS` | 10 seconds | Log error (scan may have failed). |

`SEND_FRAME` and `RECV_FRAME` have no timeouts — sends are fire-and-forget, and receives are asynchronous events.

The gateway does not retry individual commands (other than `RESET`). If a command fails, the recovery path is always: `RESET` → `MODEM_READY` → `SET_CHANNEL` → resume.

---

## 8  Protocol evolution

### 8.1  Forward compatibility

Both sides MUST silently discard frames with unrecognized `type` values. This allows either side to be upgraded independently — a newer gateway can send new command types to an older modem without breaking it, and vice versa.

### 8.2  Version detection

The `firmware_version` field in `MODEM_READY` allows the gateway to detect the modem firmware version and adjust behavior if needed (e.g., skip `SCAN_CHANNELS` if the modem predates that feature).

### 8.3  Reserved type ranges

| Range | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 0x01 – 0x0F | Core modem commands (RESET, SEND_FRAME, SET_CHANNEL, GET_STATUS, SCAN_CHANNELS) |
| 0x10 – 0x1F | [USB pairing protocol](pairing-protocol.md) host → node commands |
| 0x20 – 0x2F | BLE relay commands (BLE_INDICATE) |
| 0x30 – 0x7F | Reserved for future gateway → modem commands |
| 0x81 – 0x8F | Core modem events/responses |
| 0x90 – 0x9F | [USB pairing protocol](pairing-protocol.md) node → host responses |
| 0xA0 – 0xAF | BLE relay events (BLE_RECV, BLE_CONNECTED, BLE_DISCONNECTED) |
| 0xB0 – 0xFF | Reserved for future modem → gateway messages |
